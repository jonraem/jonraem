### 🛠️ What I Love To Work On

- **Data-intensive applications** - I love data! I thrive building high-performance systems that can handle heavy data loads.
- **Data visualization** - Complex datasets should turn into clear, actionable insights to help users make better decisions.
- **Solving problems for people** - A nifty technical solution means nothing if it doesn't deliver value to the user.
- **Application security** - Ensuring security is baked into the architecture from day one instead of as an afterthought.
